            <p>CPU (Central Processing Unit) is the core component responsible for processing data in a computer. It performs all the essential tasks such as data manipulation, calculations, and formatting information for output. As a result, when purchasing a computer, people often pay close attention to the CPU and its performance capabilities.</p>
            <P>The CPU executes instructions at an incredibly fast rate. This speed is measured in clock cycles and is commonly expressed in megahertz (MHz). The term clock speed refers to how many millions of cycles per second the CPU can perform—for example, 2000 MHz means two billion cycles per second. You can think of the CPU’s operation like a heartbeat; this rhythmic pulsing is what drives the execution of tasks within the computer system.</P>
